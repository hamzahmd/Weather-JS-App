## API and Technical Details

- In this project, [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) free API is used to collect the data corresponding to the city.
- ES6 arrow functions are used in this project.
- Fetch API (fetch() method) is used with async/await functions to get the data from the API
- The application will pop-up an error message if the city you're searching for is not in the record of the API or the input is left blank.
